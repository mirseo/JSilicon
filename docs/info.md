## JSilicon v0.2 – A Dual-Mode 8-bit CPU/ALU Core
A JavaScript-Inspired Prototype Built Under Constraint  

![JSilicon Render Image](../image//gds_render.png)

**JSilicon** is an **8-bit CPU/ALU core** designed and implemented from scratch during my mandatory military service in South Korea (2025). This project serves as a proof-of-concept, showing that a complete silicon design is achievable even in highly constrained environments.  

Version 0.2 expands on the original manual ALU functionality by adding a CPU mode that automatically executes pre-programmed instructions. To enable this, key CPU components such as a Program Counter (PC), an instruction decoder, and a register file have been integrated.  

Inspired by JavaScript's simplicity and the philosophy of accessible silicon design, the JSilicon series aims to develop an ASIC that can natively power a JS runtime.  

## Overview  
- **PC (Program Counter & ROM)** - Stores a 16x8-bit instruction set in its internal ROM and sequentially fetches them in CPU mode.  

- **Decoder** - Parses instructions from PC and generates control signals for other components.  

- **REG (Register File)** - Contains two 8-bit general-purpose registers (R0, R1) that serve as the CPU's workspace.  

- **ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit)** -  Performs eight fundamental arithmetic and logic operations, including addition, subtraction, and multiplication.  

- **SWITCH** - A multiplexer that selects the data path based on the Mode pin, switching between external manual inputs and the internal CPU core.  

- **FSM (Finite State Machine)** - Acts as the central controller, managing the timing for ALU execution and UART transmission.  

- **UART_TX** - Serializes the computation result and transmits it to an external device like a PC or MCU.

## Pinout
| Pin | Direction | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `clk` | Input | System clock (12 MHz) |
| `rst_n` | Input | Active-low reset |
| `ena` | Input | Chip enable (Active-High) |
| `ui_in[7:4]` | Input | **(Manual Mode)** Operand A (4-bit) |
| `ui_in[3:0]` | Input | **(Manual Mode)** Operand B (4-bit) |
| `uio_in[7:5]`| Input | **(Manual Mode)** Opcode (3-bit) |
| `uio_in[4]` | Input | **Mode Select** (0: Manual, 1: CPU) |
| `uo_out[7]` | Output | UART Busy Status (1: Busy) |
| `uo_out[6:0]` | Output | ALU Result, bit [6:0] (Lower 7 bits) (`alu_result[6:0]`) |
| `uio_out[7:1]`| Output | ALU Result, bits [15:8] (Upper 8 bits) (`alu_result[15:8]`) |
| `uio_out[0]` | Output | UART TX serial data output (9600 bps) |

## How to test
1. **Manual Mode(Mode = 0)**  
   Set the `uio_in[4]` pin to '0' to use the core as a manual ALU.  
   A. Provide operands: Provide **Operation A** on `ui_in[7:4]` and **Operation B** on `ui_in[3:0]` (4 bits each).  

   B. Choose operation: Set the desired operation using the Opcode on `uio_in[7:5]`.  
         - `000` : A + B  
         - `001` : A - B  
         - `010` : A * B  
         - `011` : A / B  
         - `100` : A % B  
         - `101` : A == B  
         - `110` : A > B  
         - `111` : A < B  

   C. Read the result: The result will instantly appear on the `uo_out` and `uio_out` pins.   

   D. Serial output (optional): The same result is sent via UART on the `uio_out[0]` pin.  
         - Connect a USB-to-serial adapter (9600 bps, 8N1) to read it on a PC or MCU.  
         - `uio_out[0]` reflects the UART TX line state for monitoring.  

   E. Reset the design: Drive `rst_n` low to reset the FSM and ALU state, then bring it high again to start a new computation.  

2. **CPU Mode (Mode = 1)**  
   Set the `uio_in[4]` pin to '1' to run the core in automatic CPU mode.  

      1. Once the chip is enabled (`ena` = 1), it will automatically execute the program stored in its internal ROM.  

      2. External inputs `ui_in` and `uio_in[7:5]` are ignored in this mode.  

      3. The default built-in program is as follows:  
         - `ADD 3`
         - `SUB 2`
         - `MUL 5`
         - `NOP`  (then, repeats)  

      4. The result of each instruction is streamed to the `uo_out` and `uio_out` pins and also transmitted via UART.  

## Notes

- **Clock** : Design expects a 12Mhz input clock. (TinyTapeout standard)
- **Logic Levels** : All I/O pins use 3.3 V CMOS Logic
- **Bidirectional Pins** : The uio pins are used for both input and output. As inputs, uio[7:5] select the manual opcode and uio[4] selects the operation mode. As an output, only uio[0] is actively driven for UART TX. The remaining pins (uio[3:1]) are unused.  

## Vision
JSilicon is not just a chip - it's a story of building silicon under constraints.  

This first version was created entirely during mandatory military service in South Korea, demonstrating that hardware innovation is possible even in the most limited environments. Future versions will expand JSilicon into a more capable CPU core RISC-like capabilities.

In October 2025, JSilicon v0.2 reached a major milestone:  
the successful generation of a complete **GDSII layout**, marking the transition from logic design to physical silicon.

## Author Message
Hello, I'm JunHyeok Seo, currently serving my mandatory military service here in the Republic of Korea.

The reason I created the JSilicon project was to prove that even time spent in the military can be meaningful. And I will see it through. Even when there seems to be no path forward, I will find a way, just as I always have.

You can create something like this even with a low-spec computer or on a device that lags and crashes when you open just one or two browser tabs. Do not give up. Just as I managed to build this chip, you can achieve it too.
