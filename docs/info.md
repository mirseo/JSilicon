## JSilicon v0.1 – Minimal 8-bit CPU Core

**JSilicon** is a minal **8-bit ALU core** designed and built from scratch during my mandatory military service in Korea (2025).  

It demonstrates how a working silicon design - Including ALU, FSM-based control, and UART output - can be built under extreme constraints, even inside a military internet cafe.

Although it takes two **4-bit external operands**, the core zero-extends them internally and performs **8-bit arithmetic and logic operations**, producing a **16-bit result** (lower 8 bits and exposed).  

This project marks the beginning of the **JSilicon series**, an open hardware family inspired by the simplicity of JavaScript and the philosophy of accessible silicon design
