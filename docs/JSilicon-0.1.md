# JSilicon v0.1 – Minimal 8-bit CPU Core

**JSilicon** is a minimal 8-bit CPU core built entirely from scratch during my mandatory military service in Korea (2025).  
It features a simple ALU, FSM-based control unit, and UART output, designed to demonstrate how a complete CPU pipeline can be built under extreme constraints — even inside a military internet cafe.

This project marks the beginning of the JSilicon series, a family of open-source silicon cores inspired by the simplicity of JavaScript and the philosophy of accessible hardware.
